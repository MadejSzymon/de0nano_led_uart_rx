# de0nano_led_uart_rx
LED control using UART and MATLAB script.


Instruction:


1.In pkg.sv choose baud rate.

2.Compile the project and program the FPGA.

3.Connect UART module to USB

4.Open UART_rx.m file.

5.In UART_rx.m file set baud rate (it should be the same as in pkg.sv), COM port and data that you want to send to FPGA.

6.Run UART_rx.m

PROJECT USES PIN_D3 AS UART INPUT
